Object Relational Mapping (ORM) is a technique used in creating a "bridge" 
between object-oriented programs and, in most cases, relational databases.

When interacting with a database using OOP languages, you able to perform
different operations like creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) 
data from a database. By design, you use SQL for performing these operations
in relational databases.

This repository contains files to show my understanding of the said topic.
