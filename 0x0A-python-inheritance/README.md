# Python Inheritance
python inheritance - It is a mechanism that allows you to create a hierachy
of classes that share a set of properties and methods by deriving a class from
another class. Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit
properties from another class.

# Benefits of Inheritance
- It represents real-world relationship well.
- It provides the reusability of a code.
- It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from
  another class A, then all the subclasses of B would automatically inherit
  from class A.
- Inheritance offers a simple, understandable model structure.
- Less development and maintenance expenses result from an inheritance.

Herein are practice files that show my understanding of the said topic.
